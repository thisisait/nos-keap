/**
 * cortex-resolve — phase 4 of `POST /agent/v1/validate`: operand resolution
 * against the LIVE ontology (docs/specs/cortex-validate.md §3.8, §4.3, D1).
 *
 * READ-ONLY, and that is a hard requirement rather than a happy accident
 * (spec §7.1). Every call in this module is a SELECT or an in-memory map
 * lookup. Nothing here writes a row, proposes anything, embeds anything, warms
 * an index or touches a cache a caller could observe. `validate` must stay safe
 * to call in a loop.
 *
 * The identity model (D1) is enforced HERE, as data, from
 * `NAMESPACE_POLICY` in ./cortex-opcodes:
 *
 *   tax, rel        resolved   — system scope. Legal ONLY because both layers are
 *                               ownerless, have no visibility column, and are
 *                               already enumerable wholesale by the same RO
 *                               bearer via GET /agent/v1/taxonomy/search and
 *                               GET /agent/v1/relations. `validate` answers
 *                               questions the caller can already answer with two
 *                               existing GETs: no new capability, no new
 *                               disclosure. That strict-subset argument is the
 *                               WHOLE justification — it does not generalise.
 *   kg, ent         unresolved — a constant, operand-INDEPENDENT
 *                               `namespace_not_resolvable`, emitted before any
 *                               lookup. NO DATABASE CALL IS MADE. Issuing the
 *                               lookup and discarding the result would keep the
 *                               timing oracle, which is the thing being closed.
 *   db, svc, doc    deferred   — Wing's phase 2. Skipped entirely; this module
 *                               must never learn which resources exist.
 *
 * The uniform-error rule, stated as an invariant the suite tests: for any two
 * inputs differing only in the IDENTITY of a shape-legal operand within one
 * namespace, the emitted entries are byte-identical after substituting
 * `detail.surface`. An absent `tax:` id and a `taxonomy_nodes_ext` row that
 * `registerExtNodes` dropped both yield `unknown_operand`; a `rel:` verb that
 * never existed and one sitting at `status='proposed'` both yield
 * `unknown_operand`.
 *
 * Phase 4 runs ONLY when phases 2 and 3 produced no errors (§4.3), so every
 * operand reaching this module is already grammar-legal and shape-legal.
