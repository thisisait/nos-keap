/**
 * cortex-ontology-version — Decision D4: a content hash of the LIVE operand
 * vocabulary, stamped into every AST as `binding.ontologyVersion` and published
 * additively at `GET /agent/v1/health` as `ontology.version`.
 *
 * Why a hash and not a number: there is no ontology version in this codebase.
 * `db.ontologyStats()` publishes four COUNTS; `knowledge/ontology/manifest.json`
 * carries a FILE-FORMAT version that the server never reads. A declared version
 * would need a bump discipline and would go stale the first time someone forgot.
 * A derived fingerprint cannot go stale.
 *
 * Canonical serialization — LF-joined, no trailing newline:
 *
 *   t \t <id> \t <parentId | "-"> \t <name>     every node in allNodes(), id ASC
 *   r \t <type> \t <status>                     relation_types with status IN
 *                                               ('seed','confirmed'), type ASC
 *
 * then `onto1:` + the first 16 hex chars of sha256.
 *
 * READ-ONLY. This module issues two SELECTs and touches nothing — `validate` has
 * zero side effects (spec §7.1) and this is on its hot path.

/**
 * The canonical serialization. Exported so the unit suite can assert the
 * composition directly rather than only through its digest — a hash test that
 * only compares two hashes cannot tell you WHICH field stopped mattering.
 *
 * Field choices, each load-bearing:
 *  - `allNodes()` (server/taxonomy.ts:151), NOT the `taxonomy_nodes_ext` table.
 *    `registerExtNodes` deliberately DROPS rows whose parent never resolves or
 *    whose root id is not a bare slug, and `getNode` is the only oracle the
 *    resolver uses. The fingerprint must describe the vocabulary validate
 *    actually used, not a superset that exists on disk.
 *  - `name` — a rename must invalidate a stored precedent (plan §6.3 compares
 *    "the name it had at capture"). Without `name`, a rename is invisible here.
 *  - `parentId` — a re-parent changes `node.path`, which `rebuildTaxonomyFts`
 *    indexes, which changes late-binding results. It is resolution-affecting.
 *  - `description` is deliberately EXCLUDED. K1 curated overrides
 *    (`applyDescriptionOverride`) churn editorially; invalidating every stored
 *    precedent on a wording fix costs more than it buys. Named, accepted cost: a
 *    description edit can shift an FTS ranking without moving the version. This
 *    is the one place the fingerprint is deliberately coarse.

/**
 * `onto1:<first 16 hex of sha256(canonicalOntologyVocabulary())>`.
 *
 * DIVERGENCE from the spec's (non-normative) implementation note, which suggests
 * memoizing this in a module-level cache invalidated from `registerExtNode`,
 * `registerExtNodes`, `insertProposedRelationType`, `setRelationTypeStatus` and
 * `seedRelationTypes`. It is computed FRESH on every call instead, because:
 *
 *  1. Every one of those invalidation seams would require `server/taxonomy.ts`
 *     or `server/db.ts` — modules this one imports — to import this module back.
 *     That is a genuine import cycle through the esbuild bundle, not a style
 *     objection.
 *  2. A stale fingerprint is not a slow answer, it is a WRONG one: it asserts
 *     "the ontology did not move" to a dispatcher whose entire job is to notice
 *     that it did. The failure mode of a missed invalidation site is silent and
 *     is exactly the drift this field exists to catch.
 *  3. It is one string join per node plus one sha256, on a route that is not hot
 *     and that already does several COUNT(*) queries. MEASURED at 0.18 ms per
 *     call over the 806-node seed spine — cheaper than the census beside it.
 *     server/cortex-resolve.test.ts pins the order of magnitude so a future
 *     O(n²) regression cannot hide behind "it was never cached anyway".
 *
 * Boot-scoped, and correctly so: the in-memory tree is built once at boot, while
 * `knowledge/ingest.mjs` writes `taxonomy_nodes_ext` straight to the DB file and
 * relies on a restart. Between the two, `getNode` answers "unknown" for ids that
 * exist on disk — and the fingerprint describes the tree the VALIDATOR used,
 * which is the correct semantics: an AST records what it was checked against,
 * not what another process believes.
