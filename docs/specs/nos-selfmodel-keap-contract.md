# nOS self-model → KEAP: the contract

Answers to the two questions from the nOS side, verified against the code at
KEAP v1.18.1, plus one trap that changes the shape of the proposal.

Everything below is **what exists today** unless a section says otherwise.

---

## A1 — What `[[02.02]]` actually does

**The chain.** `body` → `extractRefs()` (`server/objects.ts:37`, regex over
`[[…]]` and markdown links) → stored on `knowledge_objects.links` →
`anchorNodeIds()` keeps `kind='node'` → shipped in `/api/graph` as `anchors[]`,
filtered to nodes that resolve (`server/graph.ts:209`).

**It is not an ontological relation.** No `relations` row is written. Anchors are
*placement + membership*, nothing more. (By contrast `[[object:<id>]]` refs DO
become drawn edges — a different layer, now behind the "Links" toggle.)

**What it decides — position, and visibility.**
- Only `anchors[0]` is used. The client groups cards by first anchor and pins each
  in an orbital slot around that star's **baked** coordinate
  (`src/pages/Explore.tsx:359-376`). Remaining anchors are panel/drawer facts.
- `if (!anchor) continue;` — a card with **no** anchor is not rendered in the
  ring/constellation view **at all**. It renders only in the files core. This is
  deliberate: "free-floating dust would break spatial memory."
- A **dangling** anchor (node id that does not exist) is dropped silently, which
  lands the card in the same state as unanchored.

**So: is removing the anchors safe?** Safe for data — nothing is deleted, nothing
orphans, no cascade. But the card *disappears from the constellation view* until
it is anchored somewhere that exists. Two consequences:

1. **Replacement anchoring must land in the same change.** Removing `[[02.02]]`
   without substituting is a visibility regression, not a cleanup.
2. **Order matters: taxonomy nodes must exist BEFORE the cards point at them.**
   Anchor first, ingest nodes second, and every card is silently invisible in
   between.

**Embedding impact of removing the anchor: negligible.** `objectText()` is
`type + title + description + tags + body`, so `[[02.02]]` is embedded as a
meaningless token. The anchor is not what is hurting recall — see A3.

---

## A2 — Position is BAKED LAYOUT, categorically not embedding

`server/layout.ts:bakeLayout()` is deterministic geometry:

```
roots:    angle = (i / categories.length) * 2π,  radius 1400,  z = ±160 lift
children: breadth-first from the parent's position
```

Persisted per node in `taxonomy_layout (node_id, x, y, z, layout_version)`,
served as `x/y/z` in `/api/graph`, and the client **pins** stars to them — only
semantic dust is force-simulated.

Embeddings drive the semantic neighbourhood, the side panel, topic clustering and
R3 candidate recall. They **never** move a taxonomy star.

So "give nOS a position" means *pin a region in the baked layout*. That is real
and controllable — not something to be solved by rewriting text.

---

## ⚠ The trap: do NOT add nOS to the static seed

`ensureLayout()` re-bakes iff `computeLayoutVersion(staticNodes())` changes, and
`bakeLayout` places roots at `angle = i / categories.length`.

**Adding a 13th root to `src/game/data/taxonomy.ts` changes the divisor, so every
existing domain's angle moves.** The whole galaxy rearranges and all spatial
memory — every user's mental map of where things are — is destroyed in one
release. The code comments call a version change "a release-level seed change".

Therefore nOS must be a **delta (ext) root**, never a seed root. Grown nodes are
appended and "must never trigger (or be moved by) a full re-bake."

---

## A3 — Why the current tree hurts recall (confirms your measurement)

`objectText()` embeds `type + title + description + tags + body`. For the nine
stack cards that is: the same title (`_stack.md`), a folder path, and one
near-identical sentence. Nine nearly-identical vectors is a dense artificial
cluster that is close to everything and specific to nothing.

Measured live before the fix: those cards were the top recall hits for *Nuclear
Engineering*, *String Microstate Counting* and *Self-Assembly & Discrete
Supramolecular Architectures*. Two nodes ("Databases", "NoSQL Databases") ate 25
of 50 candidate slots in a sweep.

**Distinct titles and genuinely distinct bodies are the fix, and they are on the
nOS side.** KEAP will not paper over this by de-duplicating display names — that
would hide the signal without repairing the vector.

---

## What KEAP supports today

- **Arbitrary depth under an existing parent.** `id` matches
  `^\d{2}(\.\d{2})*$`, `level` = dot count. So nOS → stacks → systems is three
  levels: `90`, `90.01`, `90.01.01`.
- **Grown nodes via the delta**, `knowledge/canonical/<L0>/<L1>.json` applied by
  `knowledge/ingest.mjs` — idempotent, sha256-marked per file. **This is the only
  import path.** Never `docker exec` into the live DB.
- **Cards anchored to any node**, with per-card visual overrides.
- **Typed relations + moderation + the `/agent/v1/graph` brain endpoint** (R3),
  already carrying 31 confirmed edges.

## What KEAP must still build (my side, not yours)

Exactly two holes, both blocking a first-tier nOS node:

1. **`registerExtNode` cannot create a root.** `server/taxonomy.ts:195`:
   `const parent = nodesById.get(row.parentId); if (!parent) return null;`
2. **`appendExtNodeToLayout` cannot place a root.** `server/layout.ts:152`
   requires `layout.get(ext.parentId)`; a root has no parent, so it gets no
   position — and a node without a position has its cards skipped
   (`star.x === undefined`).

Plan: allow `parentId: null` for ext nodes in a **reserved id range `90`–`99`**
(so a user root can never collide with seed domains `01`–`12`), and give roots an
explicit layout placement that does not disturb the seed ring. Canonical schema +
`lint.mjs` + round-trip follow.

---

## Recommended shape

**Taxonomy (nodes, via the delta):** `nOS (90)` → stack (`90.NN`) → system
(`90.NN.MM`). Three levels, ~10 stacks, ~60 systems.

**Skills (cards, not nodes):** one card per `## skill` heading, anchored to its
system node. Keeps the taxonomy structural and gives the router one embedding per
callable action — the **Trigger:** phrases become query-side anchors directly. One
card per *system* would average 7–11 unrelated actions into a single vector,
which is precisely the failure mode that made `_stack.md` an attractor.

**Your two open items, which KEAP cannot resolve for you:**
- `docs/systems/` covers 22 systems; the live self-model describes 60. The router
  will answer confidently for a third of the estate and be silent for the rest —
  worth deciding whether that is acceptable or whether coverage comes first.
- SKILLS.md targets `dev.local` domains and `~/stacks/...` paths. Routing to
  endpoints that no longer exist is worse than not routing, so that reconcile
  should land before the cards are embedded.

# Round 2 — delivered, and the three invariants

Answering `nOS:docs/doctrine/cross-repo-contracts.md`. Full reply and reasoning:
`docs/specs/nos-selfmodel-reply-01.md`.

## Delivered on `dev` (unreleased)

| What | Commit | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Users-pass prune guards | `05d61eb` | Your objection, upheld. Refuses on cap hit, truncated walk, zero-scan-with-mirrors; `pruneRefused` surfaces on the result. |
| User-defined roots `90`–`99` | `aecd59c` | `registerExtNode` accepts a parentless node in range; roots get their own layout ring at 1.75× the seed radius. |
| Layout placement fixpoint | `aecd59c` | `listExtNodes` orders by `(created_at, ordinal)`, which says nothing about ancestry — one pass left a child preceding its parent unplaced until the next boot. |

So `90` → `90.NN` → `90.NN.MM` is now expressible and renderable. Not yet
released; the pin bump follows once you have a fixture to gate against.

## Identity

**Nodes:** the dotted id IS the identity — `90.01.03` is that system forever.
Renaming is free; renumbering is a delete plus a create, and it orphans every
card anchored to the old id. So **the id must be derived from something stable
about the service, never from its position in a sorted list.** If `90.01.03` is
"whatever sorted third in the infra stack", adding a service renumbers its
siblings and silently detaches their cards. That is the failure this section
exists to prevent, and it is entirely on the producer side.

**Cards:** `fs:<uid>:<sha1(relPath)[:16]>` — identity is the **path**, so a
renamed file is a delete plus a create (new id, new embedding, lost relations).
Path stability matters more than filename beauty; pick the names once.

## Visibility

The one that fails silently, per your own doctrine.

- A card whose `anchors[0]` does not resolve is **dropped without a warning**
  (`server/graph.ts:209`) and renders nowhere in the constellation view.
- A node with no layout position has **every one of its cards skipped**
  (`star.x === undefined`).

Both look identical to "the tree is fine but empty". Hence the ordering
constraint: **ingest nodes BEFORE re-anchoring cards.** Cards-then-nodes leaves
every affected card invisible for the width of that window, with nothing logged.

My gate asserts no card carries an unresolvable anchor, precisely because
nothing else will tell either of us.

## Removal

- **Cards:** the users pass prunes fs-sourced objects whose file is gone — and,
  as of `05d61eb`, refuses to prune whenever the found-set is untrustworthy. A
  removed service's cards disappear on the next sync. Correct and intended.
- **Nodes:** `knowledge/ingest.mjs` re-applies a canonical file when its sha256
  changes. **Dropping a node from the canonical file is what deletes it** — and
  since the taxonomy is install-invariant, a node should disappear only when nOS
  genuinely stops shipping that service, never because an estate has it disabled.
- **The asymmetry to hold:** a node outliving its cards is the designed steady
  state ("nOS can do this, you have not enabled it"). A card outliving its node
  is a bug — it becomes invisible, not an error.

## Open, and yours to answer

1. **Node-description quality.** Objection in the reply doc, with the measurement
   behind it: install-invariant taxonomy puts ~60 nodes into the space that R3
   recalls *into*, and two generically-worded nodes already took 25 of 50
   candidate slots in a live sweep. Templated descriptions would be a worse
   regression than the `_stack.md` cards, not a smaller one.
2. **Node id derivation** — see Identity. Say what it is keyed on.
3. **Skill preconditions machine-shaped** (frontmatter, not prose) if SKILLS.md
   is being rewritten anyway — see `docs/specs/conditional-relations.md`. Costs
   nothing now, saves a re-parse later.

# Round 3 — the precondition call, and who enforces ordering

## A — my advice was wrong, and the fix is neither of your first two

You are right and I was wrong: I told you to put the credential ref in
frontmatter while my own ingest replaces `frontmatter` wholesale
(`fs-sync.ts`, `{source, path, size, mtime}`) and never parses the file's YAML.
It would have been discarded, not merely unembedded. Good catch.

**But (3) misclassifies the data**, and that is worth more than the fix itself.
There are two different facts hiding under "precondition":

| Fact | Nature | Home |
|---|---|---|
| `upload-file` **requires** a Nextcloud app password | **durable** — part of what the skill *is*; true on a machine that has never heard of Nextcloud | the knowledge graph |
| this agent **currently holds** a valid Nextcloud token | **volatile** — true until it expires | the skills dataTable |

Your (3) puts *both* in the table. That is the volatile/durable split applied one
level too aggressively: the requirement is exactly the kind of thing the router
should be able to reason about offline, and it does not change when a token
rotates. Putting it in the table means the graph cannot answer "what would I need
in order to run this?" at all — only "can I run it right now".

**So: (2), with a correction about what it is for.** The precondition line lives
in the body, because that is where a *producer* reads it — the same shape as R3,
where the classifier reads card text and emits typed relations. The body line is
source material, not the queryable form. The queryable form is a typed relation:

```
(upload-file) —requires→ (nextcloud-credential)      durable, in `relations`
(agent)       —holds→    (nextcloud-credential)      volatile, in the dataTable
```

Your embedding worry about (2) is real but small, and I think it points the right
way: a router query *"upload a file to the cloud"* arguably **should** match a
card that mentions Nextcloud credentials. One line in a few hundred characters
does not make an attractor — nine identical bodies did.

**And (1) yes, separately.** fs-sync should parse the file's YAML frontmatter and
merge it under its own reserved keys — not as the precondition mechanism, but
because `title = basename` is a real cost you already named, and because "the
file says X, KEAP shows Y" is a class of surprise worth closing permanently. I am
not putting it in this contract's critical path; it should not gate your rework.

## B — upheld, with two corrections that change the remedy

Nothing enforces the ordering. Confirmed: `KEAP_FS_SYNC_INTERVAL_S` defaults to
300 and fs-sync also fires on boot, so any boot that beats your ingest re-opens
the window. I stated a constraint neither of us could enforce.

Two corrections, both of which make it smaller than it reads:

1. **It is self-healing.** The anchor is *stored* — `links` survives every sync,
   and `graph.ts:209` filters at READ time, per request. So when the nodes land,
   the cards become visible on the next graph fetch. No re-sync, no re-embed, no
   lost curation. It is a visibility window, not data loss.
2. **It was not quite silent.** `lint.ts:98` already emits `broken-anchor` at
   **high** severity, plus `orphan-object` for zero anchors. But lint runs only
   on `POST /agent/v1/lint/run` — nothing volunteers it, which for practical
   purposes is your point.

**So the remedy is reporting, not enforcement.** KEAP cannot see your playbook and
should not pretend to: a sync that writes cards with unresolvable anchors now
counts them, logs a warning, and surfaces `danglingAnchors` on the sync result
(`a84f0b3`). Zero is the normal state. Non-zero right after your ingest step is
expected and transient; **non-zero that persists across runs means cards are
anchored to nodes that will never arrive** — which is the failure actually worth
catching, and it is now visible without anyone thinking to ask.

If you want a hard gate on your side, the cheap one is: run your ingest step,
then `POST /agent/v1/fs/sync?wait=1` and fail the play if `danglingAnchors > 0`.
That enforces the ordering from the side that actually controls it.

## Pin

Held at **`v1.18.1`**, not `v1.18.0` — one correction to your round-2 note. The
pin before my bump was v1.18.1 (`40aff164`); v1.18.0 predates the split
ontology/links edge layers and the verb-grouped panel, both already deployed and
in use, so pinning there would un-ship live functionality. v1.18.1 is the true
pre-bump state and keeps the beta run identical to what is running now.

Agreed on the sequencing: a release converge and a contract migration must not be
the same run. v1.19.0 stays tagged and waits for the self-model epic.

## Describe path — noted, and it does not help you as much as I implied

You are right that drafting from READMEs covers 22 of 60 and reads stale
`dev.local` text. I should not have offered it as if it solved the content
problem: a describe pass over stale source produces *confident* stale
descriptions, which in a recall target is worse than a thin one — a wrong node
that sounds authoritative will win candidates against a right one that sounds
vague. If the READMEs are being reconciled anyway, describe is worth running
*after* that, not before, and never on the 38 systems whose only source is a
one-line manifest.

# ⚠ Superseded above: the id scheme is SLUGS, not `90`–`99`

Everything before this line that says `90`, `90.NN`, `90.NN.MM` or "reserved
range" is **historical**. It is left in place because the reasoning that produced
it is worth reading, but it does not describe the system.

**Current scheme:**

```
nos                      user root — any bare lowercase slug
nos.infra                stack
nos.infra.postgresql     system
nos.iiab.nextcloud.credential
```

The seed spine keeps its dotted 2-digit ids and is untouched. Both shapes are
valid node refs; `server/objects.ts` accepts either.

Why it changed: a numeric segment encodes **position**, so inserting a sibling
renumbers the ones after it and every card anchored to them resolves to a
different node while still looking valid. Three separate mechanisms had grown to
contain that — an id ledger on the nOS side, a drift detector here, a two-run
fixture gate — and none of us had asked why the property existed. A slug encodes
identity, so the class is deleted rather than guarded. The 99-child ceiling that
had been shaping credential placement went with it.

## Tag hazard: **never pin `v1.19.0`**

`v1.19.0` is a real, immutable, released tag that implements the abandoned
`90`–`99` scheme (`USER_ROOT_MIN` is present in it and absent from everything
after). Pinning it would make `registerExtNode` accept only two-digit roots and
reject `nos` — returning null, so no root is created, so every card under it is
invisible. Silently, as usual.

The tag is not being retracted: immutable tags are the whole point of the pin
rule, and rewriting one to mean something else is worse than leaving a documented
trap. **Pin `v1.20.0` or later for anything self-model related.**

This matters because pins have already been quoted from memory once in this
contract, in both directions.
