/**
 * Visibility & sharing contract — THE one source (dtt-share-model, 2026-09-05).
 *
 * Operator ruling (nOS docs/plans/datatables-subsystem.md §4 + the
 * caddy-transcript-visibility decision): visibility is a configurable GRADE
 * ladder, defined ONCE. This module is that once. server/rbac.ts imports the
 * ladder (it owns tier→rank resolution and enforcement); nOS's
 * cortex-caddy-transcript-visibility imports the same file; nothing else may
 * re-declare a visibility enum.
 *
 * THE LADDER (ordered by the minimum caller rank that reads it — see
 * VISIBILITY_MIN_RANK; lower rank = more privileged; admin=1 … guest=4):
 *   private        owner + admin only (rank 0 = never granted by tier)
 *   system         system principals only (agents / the estate's own jobs) —
 *                  the one grade the dtt-share-model plan added; a human tier
 *                  NEVER satisfies it, which is why its min-rank is 0 and its
 *                  enforcement keys on the principal namespace, not the rank
 *   tier-managers  Authentik tier 2 and above
 *   tier-users     tier 3 and above
 *   tier-guests    tier 4 and above (any recognized tier)
 *   shared         every authenticated caller (rank 99). This estate has no
 *                  unauthenticated readers, so `shared` IS the plan's
 *                  "public"; a wider grade would be a new row here, not a
 *                  parallel enum somewhere else.
 * Mapping from the plan's spelling: 'owner' → private (ownership is an
 * implicit ROLE — the owner always reads and writes — not a grade),
 * 'public' → shared, 'tier-<n>' → the three tier grades.
 *
 * PRINCIPALS — the ACL vocabulary (nOS docs/doctrine/identity.md §6):
 *   user:<canonicalUid>   canonical slug of the USERNAME (server/uid.ts) —
 *                         NEVER the Authentik uid, which is random and
 *                         regenerates on a tenant blank (identity.ts:83-87)
 *   agent:<name>          AgentKit client-id roster name; external agents
 *                         reserved there (agent:cursor / codex / claude-code)
 * Both halves share one slug grammar: [a-z0-9], dashes inside, max 64.
 * Existing bare `user_id` columns keep their unprefixed spelling — the
 * prefixed form is for the NEW owner/shared_with fields only.
 *
 * SHARING — `shared_with` is an explicit ACL of principals granted read or
 * write, INDEPENDENT of tier (a private table shared with one user is the
 * whole point). Attachment plan (enforcement is a separate, later change —
 * this file is the reviewable contract):
 *   - table-level: `sharing` block on the table metadata (create/update
 *     contracts + TableInfo), enforced by BOTH doors — canReadTable/
 *     canWriteTable grow a shared_with leg beside the tier ladder.
 *   - row-level: the same triple rides RESERVED `__`-prefixed meta keys
 *     (`__owner`, `__visibility`, `__shared_with`) peeled off values exactly
 *     like `__id` — identity and access are never data columns.
 * Absence-safe doctrine (settled): an unreadable table/row is ABSENT (404 /
 * filtered from listings), never a 403 that leaks existence; a write refusal
 * on something the caller CAN read is an explicit 403.
 *
 * Agent-door identity phases (schema-invariant): phase 1 the door trusts
 * `agent:<x-keap-agent>` after bearer validation (COOPERATIVE — the same
 * trust the row lease already extends); phase 2 swaps in per-agent bearers
 * (nOS CredentialResolver) with no change to any shape in this file.
 *
 * THREE SETTLEMENTS (review round 2, 2026-09-05):
 * 1. UID BOUNDARY INVARIANT: every NON-EMPTY canonicalUid/slugifyUid output
 *    is a valid principal name — the slug transform's alphabet ([a-z0-9-]),
 *    edge-dash trim and 64-cap are exactly PRINCIPAL_NAME's grammar (pinned
 *    by visibility-contract.test.ts against server/uid.ts). The one hole is
 *    the pathological EMPTY slug (username+email+uid all slugify to '') —
 *    that identity is broken upstream of sharing (it cannot own fs rows
 *    either); enforcement refuses an empty principal rather than this
 *    grammar bending to admit it.
 * 2. ABSENT OWNER = SYSTEM-OWNED: no principal holds the owner role; the
 *    table is governed by visibility + tier (+ explicit shares) alone. The
 *    user door ALWAYS stamps owner on create; only code-declared/system
 *    tables may be ownerless. A user table can never "lose" its owner into
 *    tier-writability — owner is set at birth and immutable through both
 *    doors.
 * 3. PRECEDENCE — grades narrow, grants union:
 *    - visibility GRADES compose most-restrictive-wins: a row may be MORE
 *      private than its table (__visibility=private on a tier-users table),
 *      never more open — a grade can only ever narrow tier exposure.
 *    - shared_with ACLs compose by UNION (table grants ∪ row grants), and an
 *      explicit grant MAY cross the table's grade wall — "share one row of
 *      my private table with user X" is the founding use case, and a grant
 *      names a principal deliberately, which is exactly what a tier grade
 *      cannot do. A row-level grant implies the grantee sees the table's
 *      EXISTENCE and only their granted rows in listings (absence-safe for
 *      everything else). Write implies read throughout.
