/**
 * Field concepts — L1 of the nOS genome: the common vocabulary for WHAT A
 * COLUMN MEANS.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A DataTable column carries two machine facts today — `kind`
 * (how the value is stored) and `role` (how OLAP may aggregate it) — and zero
 * facts about its meaning. `status` in five different tables is five unrelated
 * strings; `taxonomy_ref`, `owner` and `slug` repeat across every seeded table
 * with nothing tying them together. Meaning lives only in the human-readable
 * `label`, which no consumer can compare.
 *
 * That is the "no common denominator" problem, stated for one organ. This file
 * is the denominator, and it is deliberately the SMALLEST thing that can be
 * one: a closed, versioned, git-owned vocabulary with a membership gate.
 *
 * WHAT IT HONESTLY DOES, so nobody over-claims it later:
 *   - it GATES: an unknown concept is refused at write time, so the set cannot
 *     silently grow by typo the way a free-text column would;
 *   - it makes columns COMPARABLE ACROSS TABLES — "every column meaning
 *     lifecycle.status" is a query for the first time;
 *   - it gives L2 (per-concept vector slots) something to hang off; the ids
 *     here are the stable anchor L2 needs and cannot invent later.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: rendering `Label [concept]: value` into a row body does
 * NOT make embeddings concept-aware. One vector covers the whole body, which is
 * truncated before it is embedded, so a shared bracket token is a few tokens
 * diluted among thousands. It helps the lexical (BM25/FTS) leg, and that is the
 * whole of its retrieval claim until L2 lands.
 *
 * VOCABULARY DISCIPLINE. Ids are `namespace.name`. Additive-only: a concept may
 * be ADDED freely, but never removed or renamed, because a stored column may
 * reference it and there is no repair path for a stranded token. Retire by
 * marking `deprecated: true` and steering new declarations elsewhere.
 *
 * CROSS-REPO. nOS vendors this file verbatim (the `shared/contracts/cortex.ts`
 * precedent: provenance header + a vendoring gate that diffs the copies), so a
 * table definition authored in the nOS repo is validated against the same set
 * the KEAP server enforces.

/**
 * Deliberately NOT `import type { ColumnKind } from './table'` — table.ts

 * that both construct zod schemas at import time resolves to `undefined` on one

 * `kinds` entry below is a real ColumnKind is asserted by
 * field-concepts.test.ts instead, which is where a cycle-free codebase pays for

  // none of the 36)", so its timeline column shipped without a meaning.

  // never answer "did this land when we said it would".

  // A CLAIM AND AN OBSERVATION ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FACT, and this namespace

  //
  // The nOS estate paid for this repeatedly: a security queue reported fifteen
  // items pending while six were already live at their fixed version, because
  // its status was written by the process that filed the work rather than by
  // anything that looked; a backup reported success for six services whose
  // archives were empty for weeks. The shape is always a success marker
  // written by the code that attempted the work.
  //
  // So `lifecycle.status` stays what someone CLAIMS, and these three carry
  // what something OBSERVED. A row whose status says done and whose
  // verification says contradicted is the most useful row in any such table,
  // and it is unreachable in a design where one writer owns both.
